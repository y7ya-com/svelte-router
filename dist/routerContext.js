// render a `<HeadContent />`, and by `RouterProvider` when they haven't (pure
// SPA). It lets `HeadContent` render at most once per tree: the first instance
// claims the slot, any later instance (e.g. a user who also placed
// `<HeadContent />` in their root route) becomes a no-op. Without this, a
// second instance would emit a duplicate set of `<meta>` tags (Svelte
// special-cases `<title>` but not `<meta>`).
